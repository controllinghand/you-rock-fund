## [1.2.5] - May 2026
### Added
- Performance page: "Total Realized" stat card showing combined option premium + forced-sale P&L
- Performance table: separate "Premium" and "Sales P&L" columns; footer shows net effect of forced sales
- Bar chart tooltip shows sales P&L alongside premium when a forced liquidation occurred that week
### Changed
- `ytd_tracker.json` now stores `premium_collected`, `shares_sold_pnl`, and `total_realized` per week (backwards-compatible: old entries with `realized` are normalized on read)
- YTD `total_premium`, weekly `yield_pct`, and annual goal progress track option premium only — forced liquidations no longer inflate these numbers
- Sidebar version label removed — status bar version pill is the single source of truth
### Fixed
- `yrvi-build.sh`: re-queries container ID after `docker compose up --build` so health polling in Step 4 inspects the live container instead of the pre-rebuild (stale) ID

## [1.2.1] - May 2026
### Added
- Discord `🚨🚨🚨 EMERGENCY SHARE SALE` alert fires immediately on every wheel share sale (dropped screener, earnings this week, no viable CC), with ticker, shares, fill price, proceeds, reason, and realized P&L
- `_find_cc_strike()` fetches live IBKR market price before building the strike candidate list; scan floor = max(assigned_strike, current_price × 0.95) to avoid scanning deep-ITM calls when a stock has run up
- `detect_assignments()` falls back to IBKR `avgCost` when `assigned_strike` is missing from state, eliminating 0.00 placeholders
- Same avgCost fallback applied in `run_wheel_check()` Step 0 for untracked stocks detected at Monday open

## [1.2.0] - May 2026
### Added
- scripts/yrvi-restart.sh: re-injects Keychain secrets before docker restart, fixing individual container restarts
- Watchdog auto-restarts ib_gateway after 30 min down outside market hours (never during 9:30–4:00 PM ET)
- auto_restart_gateway setting with dashboard toggle (default true)
### Changed
- Watchdog alerts distinguish auto-restart attempted vs manual intervention required
